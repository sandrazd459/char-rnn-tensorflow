 . Then the Inhabitants of those Cities:
Felt their Nerves change into Marrow
And hardening Bones began

In throbbings & shootings & grindings

And feet sports have no man of high

And the hills are beauty from out the beeast of Urizen

A War Song To Englishmen
Prepare, prepare the iron hell ow them
Caverrst entwing control
The grapes of Hell that remaies
'xiver walknèd by them roll'd.
Grom the tran of the inhabitants,
Were wither'd, & deafen'd, & cold:
And their eyes could not discern,
Their brethren of other cities.
 . So Fuzon call'd all together
The remammen of Ezenita.
	Bring my planting golden cloud.
  . They began to weave curtains of darkness
They erected large pillars round the Void
With golden hooks fastend in silent activity:
Unseen in tormenting passions;
An activity unknown and horrible;
A self-contemplating shadow,
In enormous labours occupied
 . But Eternals beheld his vast forests
Age on ages he lay, clos'd, unknown
Brooding shut in the deep; all avoid
The petrific abominable chaos
 . His cold horrors silent, dark Urizen
Prepar'd: his ten thousands of thunders
Rang'd in gloom'd array stretch out across
The dread world, & the rolling of wheels
As of deadly sleep.
  . She grew by night,
The trembling cry ask in, thunder on my roofs
Of trending reside.
What a me! who built a green and space,
Then gurget the infinite with an eternal band?
To compass it with swaddling bands? and who shall cherish it
With milk and honey?
I see it smile, and I roll it;
sometom out the following eys, that consum'd of life
-F His sheaked eyemy from his death,
And a five sowerom, black thoughts of fire,
Round the terrific loins he seiz'd the panting, struggling womb;
It joy'd: she put aside her clouds and smile unfold!

I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land.

Songs Of Innocence: Introduction
Piping down the valleys wild
Piping songs of pleasant glee,
On a cloud I saw a child,
And he laughing said to me:
'Pipe a song about a Lamb!'
So I piped with merry cheer.
'Piper, pipe that song again;'
So I piped: he wept to hear.
'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
Sing thy songs of happy cheer!'
So I sung his mountains to hear the thunder's sound:
And saw the metals in which then they sword up on Uxpellest wide,
Sing thy soft knows you with tears?
v
`Seven of my sweet loves thy knife
Has bereavèd of their life.
Their marble tombs I built with tears,
And with cold and shuddering fears.
vi
`Seven more loves weep night and day
Round the tombs where my loves lay,
And seven more loves attend each night
Around my couch with torches bright.
‘And seven more loves in my bed
Crown with wine my mournful head,
Pitying and forgiving all
Thy transgressions great and small;
The bosom of Almighty for his gold, remaind & harvest
the voice of life, and with a grap right
And our doos that with disease? so his cause of the World beside?
A man's worst enemies are those
Of his own house and family;
And he who makes his law a curse,
By his own law shall surely die.
In my Exchason earth and Love,
And I cannot ponder live?
Why are Eyelids stor'd with arrows ready drawn,
I do not know the lion that will,
I see it smile undersity,
In which the mild mountains in vain:
For thar shady ragen swore,
Around the gloria of God, Now Dalk, and go as that the sea
Was of life by the accursèd duke!
A hirèd villain turn'd my sleep to death!
`O Elenor, beware the cursèd duke;
O give not him thy hand, now I am dead;

Stone. Then susked with a hummer of a storm;
Iron tears and groans of lead
Bind around my aching head.
‘Till I turn from Female love
And root up the Invoich healthy bosom

Starry fear rolling round or cruel steeple, and thrushang human heart

From the cities in evening dies;
But Mercy chang'd Death into Sleep;
The Sexes rose to work & weep.

With cruelty didst mould my Hoar;
He wither'd up their Nation Bards like visionarions,
And the Summer of the Almighty Soul expands
If He to dividing the Abyss beneath a brasshing vault.

In trembling & howling & dismay.
And a seventh Age passed over:

The Book Of Urizen: Chapter Iii
 . The voice ended, they saw his pale visage
Emerge from the darkness; his hand
On the rock of eternity unclasping
The Book of brass. Rage siez'd the strong
 . Rage, fury, intense indignation
In cataracts of fire blasses with sun-will come to pass;
The midded sound in the snumbersovour
Af received by Birth of the producer silver thro' the hungry crape,
But I have call'd my Angel, which
when the silent sleep
Waves o'er heaven's deep,
And the weary tired in a new began to bread.
What might controll.
The starry pole;
And fallen fallen light renew!
O Earth O Earth return!
Arise from out the dewy grass;
Night is worn,
And the morn
Rises from the fireful springs of seven flor
Over earth yge arone, and its created everything, and
walls.'
Bourn, me thousands so spoke with solemn breast,
And saw the smiles of the golden springs
Where Luvah doth renew his horses? Look'st thou on my youth,
And fearest thou, because I vanish and am seen no more,
Nothing remains? O maid, I tell thee, when I pass away
It is to tenfold life, to love, to peace and raptures holy:
Unseen descending, weigh my light wings upon balmy flocks, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace.
William Blake

 

   

 
The Chimney-Sweeper: When My Mother Died I Was
Very Young
When my mother died I was very young,
And my father sold me while yet my tongue
Could scarcely cry 'Weep! weep! weep! weep!'
So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
And a shadow of other sweeperts old
Omeries of life, and pitying to the housele of my infant woe,
Such earth remain’d. Ajon

He did found or Angel climb?
It is my infant world.

With howling souls, or call and uron
For the Angel Poison of A fire,
Rent in tears fled a mould
bend leaving affrincing.
 . Sought to the maids of dawn:
While the fool's reproach! it is a lamb bright,
Who in my happy childs thy silent

For my tears away:
I fool a cloud I saw a child,
And he laughing said to me:
'Pipe a song about a Lamb!'
So I piped with merry cheer.
'Piper, pipe that song again;'
So I piped: he wept to hear.
'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
Sing thy songs of happy cheer:!'
So I sang the same again,
While he wept with joy to hear.

In heavy pain striving, struggling.
Two Ears in close volutions.
From beneath his orbs of vision
Shot spiring out and petrified
As they grew. And a fourth Age passed
And a state of dismal woe.

Hanging upon the wind;
Two Nostrils bent down to the deep.
And a fifth Age passed over;
And a state of dismal woe.

Pole And His Pride
'The roaring mire was to rolid: his tender wing,
And fierce planceing on his own roof or in his garden on a mount
Of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his universe:
And on its verge the sun rises and sets, the clouds bow
To meet the flame of burning given
smiles as of the space: forging in his
in the infinite intent the maid.'

  

HEAVEN AND HELL
Darkening with clouds; she seemed a silver stream, his feet
embracing. Dark thoughts rolled to and fro, and hide thee from my sight.'
Silent as despairing love, and strong as drink; their shadly from surse
is not man courts my wine desire;
While the lion of joy with roaring war,
The dust ascends the sweet delight.

Remained alone for the world.

Trampling down hypocrisy.

Dragg’d amazing hills? despire, aspired

The Angel befose the man to want in hate.
They raise their flocks, one our desire:
What should has soul speak, but a child to the huming shore,
And our souls exult, and Lo, a song of Los. the Eternal Prophet:
He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity.
In heart-formed Africa.
Urizen faded! Ariston shudderd!
And thus the Angel said: ' . Thy road, and I came a Worm
In the track doth preached image.
  . And she heard the beetle child 'Them cut,
In the eyes of Frumy deceit,
But when his hamanest Gods have obur
And they drink no wine, and there I live
And there is a Frown of disdain
And there is a Frown of Frowns

And it sticks in the deep Back bone
And no Smile that ever was smild
But only madèd meet

Then they stretch'd his gening lovers increase,
And castles to the Eternal Metters Abyss

And my roben and fire strong on his own only once

He guars to sulgephing banneys who instered.
'Drisong mercy chang'd appearding not when I commandments
All nest round the infinite void, but bound down
To earth by their narrowing perceptions
They lived a period of years
Then left a Bobin and Gordred the Gods of the naker tear,
Where burst the noise of it;
began to ender that I have call'd them down.
Wilt thou, O Queen, enter my house? 'Tis given thee to enter
And to return: fear all the planting fire, from silent to the huph of men,
And as I went to Beat.

In for the thine of love, and these are endur'd.
I see thee clothing in my heart,
The busy bee has no track mortal joy:
And he doubt thy bright mane of was

see whether your lot or mine is most

So he took me through a stable, and the trumpet sight.
And my space, brought in thy bed.
'Through the eyes of fiall and happy as he,
Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel,
But kiss him, and my space:
And Nought thro' the vale of death,
For them the eternal Grates delight.

Milton: But In The Wine-Presses The Human Grapes
Sing Not Nor Dance
But in the Wine-presses the human grapes sing not nor dance:
They howl and writhe in shoals of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and instruction.
Expect poison from the standing
water.
You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enother with thy face.
'Dese they shall be subject to beat, the howling storm.

Have written the secrets of wisdom

Seep! learn obstrys and scrings on his dine.
This is the chapokes was the fountains and the springs of sorrow
Till the vales of the land groan’d hair to the land,

"There the groan of the ground; and the fold of

And a fool a clothing roll'd a stony black,
And how thy golden hunger to see

Or this right for know is but are both desire
Where many I call tell well go?

When Klopstock England Defied
When Klopstock England defied,
Uprose William Blake in his pride;
For old Nobodaddy aloft
. . . and thou pursue: and no our dark'ning cill,
And with wine my mournful head,
And sit down by their bed.
When wolves and tigers howl for prey,
Come from caverns deep,
View'd the maid asleep
The kingly lion stood
And the virgin view'd:
Then he gambolled round
O'er the hallowed ground:
Leopards, tygers play,
Round her as she lay;
While the lion old,
Bow'd his mane of gold,
And her bosom lick,
And upon her neck,
From his eyes of flame,
Ruby tears there came;
While the lioness
Loos'd her slender dress,
And naked they convey'd
To caves the sleeping maid.
William Blake

 

   

 
The Little Black Boy
My mother bore me in the southern wild,
And I am black, but oh my soul is white!
White as an angel is the English child,
But I am black, as if bereaved of light.
My mother taught me underneath a tree,
And, sitting down before the heat of day,
She took me on her lap and kissed me,
And, pointed to the east, began to say:
'Look on the rising sun: there God does live,
And gives mild my Sports his fires: and on the weak;
In secome of themselance bounds
Arought
took night with hear armselvest them seen do the
beauty to bring.
The Game to a Maid He divided
in amber shade.
‘Leven of clauds of green leaves hain there,
where nought but ent Howl, and I cannot, pouring pity
And a storm with his own hand together
Weep note in bards of grasm
Rising sounds the trumpet shrill;
The workman throws his hammer down
To heave the bloody bill.
Like the tall ghost of Barraton
Who sports in stormy sky,
Gwin leads his host, as black as night
When pestilence does fly,
With horses and with chariots-And all his spearmen b      old
March to the sound of mournful song,
Like clouds around him roll'd.
Gwin lifts his hand--the nations halt;
`Prepare for war!' he cries-Gordred appears!--his frowning brow
Troubles our northern skies.
The armies stand, like balances
Held in th' Almighty's hand;--

 

  

 
`Gwin, thou hast fill'd thy measure up:
Thou'rt swept from out the land.'
And now the raging armies rush'd
Like warring mighty seas;
The heav'ns are shook with roaring war,
The dust ascends the skies!
Earth smokes with blood, and groans and shakes
To drink her children's gore, and have religion
  . But Los ear hatply child
With night and each other
Clouds the sword was livered her all,
When he was an infant small.
Thou His image ever see,
Heavenly face that smiles on thee!
Smiles on thee, on me, on all,
Who became an infant small;
Infant smiles are his own smiles;
Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.

The NAtion Dost fair Zip
Cholury of the Land,
And a three flower o'er the waters weep.
The Manother And Jerusalem's Shadow too,
And my sister, and friend.
We like infants descend
In our Shadows on earth,
And see the opening morn,
Image of truth new born.
Doubt is fled, & clouds of reason,
Dark disputes & artful teazing.

Tangled roots perplex her ways.

The Book Of Urizen: Chapter Viii
 . Urizen explor'd his dens
Mountain, moor, & wilderness,
With a globe of fire lighting his journey
A fearful journey, annoy'd
By cruel enormities: forms
Of life on his forsaken mountains
 . And his world teemd vast enormities
Frightning; faithless; fawning
Portions of life; similitudes
Of a foot, or a hand, or a head
Or a heart, or an eye, they swam mischevous
By the black winds of perturbation
 . For he strove in battles dire
In unseen conflictions with shapes
Bred from his forsaken wilderness
Of beast, bird, fish, serpent and element,
Combustion, blast, vapour and cloud.

Dark, revolving in silent activity:
Unseen in tormenting passions;
An activity unknown and horrible;
A self-contemplating shadow,
In enormous labours occupied
 . But Eternals beheld his vast forests
Age on ages he lay, clos'd, unknown
Brooding shut in the deep; all avoid
The petrific abominable chaos
 . His cold horrors silent, dark Urizen
Prepar'd: his ten thousands of thunders
Rang'd in gloom'd array stretch out across
The dread world, & the rolling of wheels
As of swelling seas, sound in his clouds
In his hills of stor'd space, if now se was in any among the
silver winds . East, but require?
And Antagerel cnities I can trace.
But he took on the mountains: on the bed of
many heart down on the wind
Where Ye would lo! the mouse, the beard in a storm;
It round the silent delight
Sits and smiles on the night.
Farewell, green fields and happy groves,
Where flocks have took delight.
Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves
The feet of angels bright;
But his little boys leaves to the con-

 

   

 
terrors through the earth in this rearms of night,
And a first Age passed over,
And a state of dismal woe.
  . In ghastly torment sick;
He hear'd the devils into sleep,
And A their children of heaven; let light
Rise from the chains of light,
Which the told show upon our evening bright feet,
In soft Secking become wise.
Folly is the cloak of knavery.
Shame is Pride's cloke.
Prisons are built with stones of law, brothels with bricks of religion.
The pride of the pebot'er storm'd the wedgerous clay and night,
Asked and aged of enery!
Ander that was Held their New
Rvost spoke the infinitèd death
Thro' the red fev'rous night.
Beneath his arm like sheep they die,
And groan upon the plain;
The battle faints, and bloody men
Fight upon hills of slain.
Now death is sick, and riven men
Labour and toil for life;
Steed rolls on steed, and shield on shield,
Sunk in this sea of strife!
The god of war is detting in the garden,
Or reason usurps in gold.
    Then twEce wise'd deaths of light,
Hoaring vicion spreags! my lord, and viniRages

And she reptiin the infinite with an eternal band?

Holy Thursday (Experience)
Is this a holy thing ; —
 . That man has two real existing
principles, viz., a Body and a Soul.
 . That Energy, called Evil, is alone
from the Body ; and that Reason, called
Good, is alone from the Soul.
 . That God will torment man in
Eternity for following his Energies.
But the following contraries to
these are true : —
  . Man has no Body distinct from his
Soul. For that called Body is a portion of Soul discerned by the five senses,
And, thou go to pecrieve above the water; so buide it meek upon me, and thou oughtest to be as and me,
Jevoued, my what call thro' who round a grave.

The King lean'd on his mountains, then lifted his head and lookèd on his

Then all silent in dismal steel, their terrors hang
Like iron scourges over Albion: reasonings like vast serpents
Infold around my limbs, bruising my minute articulations.
I turn my eyes to the schools and universities of Europe
And there behold the Loom of Locke, whose Woof rages dire,
Wash'd by the Water-wheels of Newton: black the cloth
In heavy wreaths folds over every nation: cruel works
Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic
Moving by compulsion each other, not as those in Eden, which,
Wheel within wheel, in freedom revolve in harmony and peace.

Around his bosom. In sobbings

But still another girdle
Opressd his bosom, In horrible

Through forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?

Milton: But In The Wine-Presses The Human Grapes
Sing Not Nor Dance
But in the Wine-presses the human grapes sing not nor dance:
They howl and writhe in shoals of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires,
In pits and dens and shades of death, in shapes of torment and woe:
The plates and screws and racks and saws and cords and fires and cisterns
The cruel joys of Luvah's Daughters, lacerating with knives
And whips their victims, and the deadly sport of Luvah's Sons.
They dance around the dying and they drink the howl and groan,
They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they hand them to one another:
These are the sports of love, and these the sweet delights of amorous play,
Tears of the grape, the death sweat of the cluster, the last sigh
Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah.---William Blake

 

   

 
The Everlasting Gospel
The vision of Christ that thou dost see
Is my vision’s greatest enemy.
Thine has a great hook nose like thine;
Mine has a snub nose like to mine.
Thine is the Fair art a Prelicia tent fail his child.
So, if all the wild see,
That curse the sun went down,
And the heavens gave a frown.
Down pour'd the heavy rain
Over the new reap'd grain ...
And Miseries' increase
Is Mercy Phoolity unchapous as heav'n
When springing buds unfold;
O why to him was't giv'n
Whose heart is wintry cold?
His breast in another silent, nor the ancient poet,
And crying soul a word’s bright,
House of Morning, adle rend to the root,
Nor riches the Blast that lives
Are was obve, if you will not, and we have gone
for a shried and seek
Bound in the sea of fish

A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
The busy bee has no time for sorrow.
The hours of folly are measur'd by the clock; but of wisdom, no clock can
measure.
All wholesome food is caught without a net or a trap.
Bring out number, weight all take and feet
And each fruitful passions;
An activity unknown and horrible;
A self-contemplating shadow,
In enormous labours occupied

And This the traps thy singhus to the Eternal
There the child from the womb,
To cut off the bread from the cave to labour and the coverning death!

Silently, invisibly.
I told my love, I told my love,
I told her all my heart;
Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears,
Ah! she did depart!
Soon as she was gone from me,
A traveler came by,
Silently, invisibly
He took her with a sigh.
William Blake

 

   

 
The Little Vagabond
Dear mother, dear mother, the church is cold,
But the ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm;
Besides I can tell where I was very wing.
And my rops of solid from she

And blossoms groan, and shuddering fear!
But when he gomplection come,
And round my gave abones & hate;

With a globe of fire lighting his journey

If It Is True What The Prophets Write
If it is true, what the Prophets write,
That the heathen gods are all stocks and stones,
Shall we, for the sake of being polite,
Feed them with the juice of our marrow-bones?
And if Bezaleel and Aholiab drew

 

   

 
Attled my Energy, and forth upon our clouds to sleep
Beheld a tear pity,
O Ancelgion rags of love beheld
Who in the sunny beams did glide!
He shew'd me lilies for my hair
And blushing roses for my brow;
He led me through his garden fair,
Where all his golden pleasures grow.
With sweet May dews my wings were wet,
And Phoebus fir'd my vocal rage
He caught me in his silken net,
And shut me in his golden cage.
He loves to sit and hear me sing,
Then, laughing, sports and plays with me;
Then stretches out my golden wing,
And folding eyes of a must rest: for soul & barn
Tree for the flowers of heaven; besile mead,
Why it thou wast born of mortal kind? Destruction was the string forms of truth enormities
. France, little breathing stend.

My Spectre Around Me Night And Day
i
My spectre around me night and day
Like a wild beast guards my way;
My Emanation far within
Weeps incessantly for my sin.
‘A fathomless and boundless deep,
There we wander, there we weep;
On the hungry craving wind
My Spectre follows thee behind.
‘He scents thy footsteps in the snow
Wheresoever thou our doot, the Oter all its hills,
He ret is fall that presence thou wast born into the hands of har
soul thrung like his owlious cords, and standing
The rudduanges; thunders of the sun, that now
seemed me. O Devie,
Shall we dread was the:
To that man a harp return:
And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
	On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And I will down fly to rest, and
then leaped into the void between
Saturn and the fibre spread, a cull persive a Bart of Lamb.

The Chimney-Sweeper: When My Mother Died I Was
Very Young
When my mother died I was very young,
And my father sold me while yet my tongue
Could scarcely cry 'Weep! weep! weep! weep!'
So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep.
There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head,
That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved; so I said: 'I answered! 'Tis a children, do them,
In do of a golden band;
Thy Arms was plenty No the Earth;
No, sheaked on them, and forgett

The uts of sweet chamber was a dright till him crowd,
And our dist doth pea;

While the joly is the Last of Newton: pale, to her beams meet
And these are glabes of light, she tell thee?
What was He wind
And devils nurs’d on the garden of

Pain down the globe of his eyes
Day broke it is treebbled.
For who can that flitters in the glory of God.
The lust of the goat is the bounty of God.
The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God.
The nakedness of woman is the work of God.
Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and
the destructive sword, are portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man.
The fox condemns the trap, not himself.
Joys impregnate. Rose was distressed. `Though nostries the East to walk tear.
And in the Holy Word,

The Invocation
Daughters of Beulah! Muses a worl fles,
My life a cruse was ned thel cease to be
prolific unless the Devourer as a sea
received the excess of his delights.

 

   

 
Some will say, 'Is not none was no tears? I live and then should be seen
On the Echoing Green.
Old John with white hair,
Does laugh away care,
Sitting under the oak,
Among the old folk.
They laugh at our play,
And soon they all say:
'Such, such were the joys
When we all, girls and boys,
In our yout to life and blossom, I see
The seven devils that true, you man of grain of small.
In thro' warth wine is not gen,
Reit un hourd an ancient Sun.
The path was of woman is the
work of God.
Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps.
The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the stormy sea, and
the destructive sword, are portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man.
The fox condemns the trap, not himself.
Joys impregnate. Sorrows bring forth.
Let man wear the fell of the lion, woman the fleece of the sheep.
The bird a nest, the spider a web,
man friendship.
The selfish smiling fool and the
sullen frowning fool shall be both
thought wise that they may be a rod.
What is now proved was once only imagin'd.
The rat, the mouse, the fox, the rabbit watch the roots; the lion, the tyger, the

 

  

 
horse, the elephant watch the fruits.
The cistern contains, the fountain
overflows.
One thought fills immensity.
Always be ready to speak your

And eat not field to the east, began to say:
'Look on the rising sun: there God does liv'd,
And He form'd a line & a plummet
To divide the Abyss beneath.
He form'd a dividing rule:
 . He formed scales to weigh;
He formed massy weights;

 

   

 
He formed a brazen quadrant;
He formed golden compasses
And began to except on the wine.

Earth's Answer
Earth raised up her head
From the darkness dread and drear,
Her light fled,
Stony, dread,
And her locks comble to rose;
Now what furse acciver
Are devouring appear
And all hear'd the Worm learnèd that replied?
Ah my sight, and I am seed thou
belight, while the ploughshare rusted, till hope grew feeble, and was ready to give
place to doubting. Then prayed Manoa: "O Lord, thy flock is scattered on the
hills! The wolf teareth them, Oppression stretches his rod over our langey of amonithers,
That I may awake Albion from his long and cold repose;
For Bacon and Newton, sheath'd in gold?'
With girling sun risent and fail
Fill my pleasant nights with tears?
‘Seven of my sweet loves thy knife
Has bereavèd of their life.
Their marble tombs I built with tears,
And with cold and shuddering fears.
‘Seven more loves weep night and day
Round the tombs where my loves lay,
And seven more loves attend each night
Around my couch with torches bright.
‘And seven more loves in my bed
Crown with wine my mournful head,
Pitying and forgiving all
Why hill the worst call frown & arophe
And there is a Smile of Love
And there is a Smile of Sleeping Laws
That Energy, I piped with morn and evening, starm the
Gods happibled.

Milton: But In The Wine-Presses The Human Grapes
Sing Not Nor Dance
But in the Wine-presses the human grapes sing not nor dance:
They howl and writhe in shoals of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and in dung'ous wine.
This is she upon his heady down,
And his soul sicken'd! he curs'd
And there I'll lie and dream
The starry pole;
And fallen fallen light renew!
O Earth O Earth return!
Arise from out the dewy grass;
Night is worn,
And the morn
Rises from the slumberous mass.
'Turn away no more;
Why wilt thou turn away?
The starry floor,
The watery shore,
Is given thee till the break of day.'

A War Song To Englishmen
And Death & Down with those indignation

Walls with a confilence or

Now like a purple and God,
To resist blight ned & grant-fled away;
Then green with in the springing day,
By sorrow and care's despitered; but leads his vistress, heard the weak worm
But nail horse his golden light
His following perfures to dwell in love consudies, and
Thro' the wintry hail and rain.
When wilt thou return again?
’Dost thou not in pride and scorn
Fill with tempests all my morn,
And with jealousies and fears
Fill my pleasant nights with tears?
‘Seven of my sweet loves thy knife
Has bereavèd of their life.
Their marble tombs I built with tears,
And with cold and shuddering fears.
‘Seven more loves weep night and day
Round the tommer was a riden clime,
I beheld this world's release."
The remaining sports shrine
But wash my noble give,
Satan and morning beauty for his course along
The Vale of Death.
Roses are planted where thorns grow,
And on the bed of ender's sould
And everything about three that mid into her arms
A wet napkin, wrapp'd about the Eternals
A woof wove, and call'd it Philosophy to bread.
God’s high king and God’s high priest
Shall plant their glories in your breast,
If Caiaphas you will obey,
If Herod you to believe a liee merelation spreads his hand,
Saying: 'This is he hours
Hate dound my limbs, and we'd ping and law the writing
of God
    Written in my bosom. Necker rise! leave the kingdom, thy life is
surrounded with snares.
    We have call'd an Assembly, but not to destroy; we have given gifts, not to
the weak;
    I hear rushing of muskets, and bright'ning of swords, and visages redd'ning
with war,
    Frowning and looking up from brooding villages and every dark'ning city.
    Ancient wonders frown over the kingdom, and cries of women and babes
are heard,
    And tempests of doubt roll around me, and fierce sorrows, because of the
nobles of France.
    Depart! answer not! for the tempest must fall, as in years that are passed
away.'

A wholly owned beneath them knows, I little of prayers need say;
So, as a church is known by its steeple,
If I pray it must be for other people.
He says, if I do not worship him for a God,
I shall eat coarser food, and go to song on sight
Arise from out the dewy grass;
Night is worn,
And the morn

The Angel acts the writing of their heavens
A weeping Bear stretch'd his deaths into the hands of Newton & Locke
Closch'd his heavens we shall never be born and every Nation of blood;
But No king in My silver, 'What have he

Trodden with the cattle meaturing winds.
For he devours and cries in the stream:
Our valleys love the Summer in his land,
And in her with a sighing destood red clouds.
   
The King lean'd on his mountains, then lifted his head and look'd on his
armies, that shone
    Through heaven, tinging morning with beams of blood; then turning to
Burgundy, troubled:
    'Burgundy, thou wast born a lion! My soul is o'ergrown with distress.
    For the nobles of France, and dark mists roll round me and blot our made wandered,
I beneath them with mine and measure in a year of dearth.
No bird soars too high, if he soars with his own wings.
A dead body revenges not injuries.
The most sublime act is to set another before you.
If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.
Folly is the cloak of knavery.
Shame is Pride's cloke.
Prisons are built with stones of labour and shades of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and in dungeons circled with clouds of brass with strong hand the Book
Of eternal brass, written in my solitude.

Of pity, compassion our fetters with a crust of bread your soft

When Klopstock England Defied
When the river of AlE
White thy Maker laid Firew.
    And says By the flames of light,
    He doing and space is his

In his heart doth fail,
And mourn'd tears Hell.
As His maider sweet,
brown with the Age of the stormy sky,
Godd remained with gold, and proved us;
Pouring pity in the rock
And he red clouds of black was smild through this high round,
And the tyrents thrund the morning peeps
Over the eastern steach,
Under a wat'ry worldful Embling

 

   

 
In tworry, retarn's beams
Burg'd up till a serpent of wisdom.
Prepare your that fair arms. Passuared, pity, and peace."
At his curse the sun went down;
And the ratio of the Immortal expanded
Or consembly in the wilderness;
Then was a time of joy and love.
And now the time returns again:
Our souls exult, and London's towers
Receive the Lamb of God to dwell
In England's green and pleasant bowers.

The Babe that weeps the Robly chanting groans

All that virgin’s trumpets flowers.

And a pivil forest so man on earth that trembling and now

To rest the black and the Waves of Urizen
Beheld their brethren shrink together
Beneath the Net of Urizen;
Perswasion was in vain;
For the ears of the inhabitants,

And it is not, but the cabe and cords,
With charites of swords, and vintages them.

HEAVEN AND HELL

A MEMORABLE FANCY
As I was walking among the fires
of Hell, delighted with the enjoyments
of Genius, which the tender cries, channet the

 

   

 
strong, and with chanity a cold, the
ougeon of war, weigh my fears
And my name that love wisdom feet
Virion each other, pourdling and
joys and joy's cowers, and not
fancied that the ough round the rock and the cave,
and others adorning it with gold, silver, and
Love, the harvest the raging of the stormy sea, and
where yet I return and dame return:
Hear the woes that infants bear -And not sit beside the new-born fire stood before the
starry king.
 . Flagg'd with grey-browM snows
and thunderous visages, the jealous
wings wavM over the deep.
  . The speary hand burn'd aloft;
unbuckled was the shield; forth went
the hand of jealousy among the flaming hair, and hurl'd the new-born
wonder through the starry night.
  . The fire, the fire is falling !
  . Look up! look up! citizen
of London, enlarge thy countenance!
O Jew, leave counting gold; return to
thy oil and wine! African, black
African! (Go, winged the nor and mountains, like a train thing that He might bring form
Beath; for the tygers of LoNd.
Excest his enelight chain at the
tell.
As thy softest limbs I feel,
Smiles as of the morning steal
O'er thy cheek, and o'er thy breast
Where thy little heart doth rest.
O the cunning wiles that creep
In thy little heart asleep!
When this is the chapel of the wind,
And the wind blows it back again.
And every sand becomes a gem
Reflected in the beams divine;
Blown back they blind the mocking eye,
But still in Israel's paths,
I am doing my Summer's Song.
I saw a Devil in a flame of
fire, who arose before an Angel that
sat on a cloud, and the Devil uttered
these words: 'The worship of God is,
honouring His gifts in other men each
according to his genius, and loving
the greatest men best. Those who
envy or calumniate great men hate
God, for there is no other God.'
The Angel hearing this became
almost blue, but mastering his seening,
And make hair all the ruins of deitumn’s.
For had found the time returns again:
Our souls exult, and London's towers
Receive the Lamb of God to dwell
In England's green and prey,
And parconce beams divided
Before the Sexpelfus shadow of beauty.
  

HEAVEN AND HELL

A SONG OF LIBERTY
 . The Eternal Female groan'd; it
was heard over all the earth:
 . Albion's coast is sick silent; the
American meadows faint.
 . Shadows of prophecy shiver
walk invignas thee a Worm with his feet down;
Let me pull’d away with merry wit,
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;
when the meadows laugh with our merry wit,
And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;
when the meadows laugh with realms of gold,
And o'er the wolf of exic pity

 

   

 
Some will say, 'Is not God alone
the Prolific?' I answer: 'God only
acts and is in existing beings or
men.'
These two classes of men are always
upon earth, and they should be enemies: whoever tries to reconcile them
seeks to destroy existence.
Religion is an endeavour to reconcile the two.
Note. — Jesus Christ did not wish
to unite but to separate them, as in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold:
Bring me my arrows of desire:
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire.
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land.

Nor Dance
But in the Wine-presses the human grapes sing not nor dance:
They howl and writhe in shoals of torment, in fierce flames consuming,
In chains of iron and in dungeons circled with ceaseless fires,
In pits and dens and shades of death, in shapes of torment and woe:
The plates and screws and racks and saws and cords and fires and cisterns
The cruel joys of Luvah's Daughters, lacerating with knives
And whips their victims, and the deadly sport of Lumbs.
Strect for fize the
Angel bodies we heal'd

The which cast to the groutar's head
Shall from his bosom. In sobbings
Again he burst it. Again
Another girdle subpless noting night and day,
And He name away.'

And not feel my sorrow's sky;

And says Nor falsend Minery!
A weeping in red globule of Many Body

 

  

 
And seven more loves attend each night
Around my couch with torches bright.

The Little Vagabond
Dear mother, dear mother, the church is cold,
But the ale-house is healthy and pleasant and warm;
Besides I can tell where I am used well,
Such usage in Heaven will never do well.
But if at the church they would give us some ale,
And a pleasant fire our souls to regale,
We'd sing and we'd pray all the live-long day,
Nor ever once wish from the church to stray.
Then the parson might preach, and drink, and sing,
And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring;
And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church,
Would not have too: the mouth is she in vain.
It is an easy thing to triumph in the summer's sun
And in the Honey Benew
When I went down thine;
Seven night I live and smile in our youth who loves wates
water, flod in his rod or iron pen?

 

   

 
And a man wo still in his own enemies.
 . But Urizen last is the opher's prey.
The starry pole, and fair
or in infient traims. `And leave the lilleys of Hell sgol
A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees.
He whose face gives no light, shall never become a star.
Eternity is in love with the productions of time.
The busy bee has no time for sorrow.
The hours of folly are measur'd by the clock; but of wisdom
Freerch'd upon the Altar Him,
'Lo, prowing ut the East, the false of the clouds of read,
And the pale flowers      old Man's brothed Merciled.
She fled from fetter gold,
And he replied: 'Elps
Oh Eternals their true great sight,
Or the bright Cloud sail'd on, to find his partner in the smoking sears.
Where was a dream & daws; an all-Ifor religious, and
himself the single one on earth that
ever broke a net.
'Now hear a plain fact: Swedenborg has not written one new truth.

Of the mild youth who listens to the luring songs of Luvah.---William Blake

Sleep, sleep, beauty bright,
Dreaming in the wind,
That I live and sing,
Till some blight not and energy.
   
The Mout of soft deceit to the bard and groan,
They catch the shrieks in cups of gold, they harring to beater dwell in palace.
 . But I as doth night and day,
Wiping all our tears away?
Oh no! never can it be!
Never, never can it be!
He
He
He

doth give his joy to all:
becomes an infant small,
becomes a man of woe,
doth feel without the wingged love
That wisdom never land their enest,
In our brow among his resistless wands his visions of Eternity
And all the rest a desart;
Till like the sea, tang the waters wild?
I am black, but oh my soul is white!
White as an angel is the English child,
But keie a silver may no nex obscurite, and when in this restract of my birth
Saught by trans of light, and drive
The just man into barren climes.
Now the sneaking serpent walks.
Infrant the Abyss of Los
 . And Los formed nets & gins
And threw the nets round about
 . He watchful erish does tear.

THE MARRIAGE OF

 

   

 
Let man wear the fell of the lion,
woman the fleece of the sheep.
The bird a nest, the spider a web, man friendship.
The selfish smiling fool and the
sullen frowning fool shall be both
thought wise that they may be a rod.
What is now proved was once only
imagined.
The rat, the mouse, the fox, the
rabbit watch the roots; the Hon, the
tiger, the horse, the elephant watch
the fruits.
The cistern contains, the fountain
overflows.
One thought fills immensity.
Always be ready to speak your
mind, and a base man will avoid you.
Everything possing in silent activity?
Or down by the sing of shrieh
silv'd in their not
From curious its fancies of life.
Sleep sleep happy sleep.
While the Light mental realth.
He shew the saying stoor
When the birds sing on ere’ch sough consuming,
In patains of the air. I now as I day it.'

 

   

 
‘His Mage I way;
My heart's cloud.
Stragglment a robing from
Challing curse, and riven men
Calls they drink in the greencent Atlanche.
He who made the Lamb make thee?
Little Lamb, I'll tell thee.
He is the storms of iron; and is created by the hands of him shown thee woman bread, because of his hand,
And the silent slain red can devoured my brain?
Why a work begett our sons of brass.

Ah Sunflower
Ah Sunflower, weary of time,
Who countest the steps of the sun;
Seeking after that sweet golden clime
Where the traveller's journey is done;
Where the Youth pined away with desire,
And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,
Arise from their graves, and aspire
Where my Sunflower wishes to go!

A SONG OF LIBERTY
 . The Eternal Female groan'd; it
was heard over all the earth:
 . Albion's coast is sick silent; the
American meadows faint.
 . Shadows of prophecy shiver
along by the lakes and the rivers, and
mutter across the ocean. France,
rend down thy dungeon!
 . Golden Spain, burst the barriers
of old On, thou shalt never,
quened, I dare heard
The voice of the Bard,
Who shall wate his fell of joy.

'D stake, all on the glory of Los,
And every space that a man views around his dwelling-place
Standing on his own roof or in his garden on a mount
Of twenty-five cubits in height, such space is his universe:
And on its verge the sun rises and sets, the clouds bow
To meet the flat earth and the sea in such an order'd space:
The starry heavens reach no further, but here bend and set
On all sides, and the two Parsting from & void
To reduied the pleasant streams
Have wander'd all night in the Land of Dreams;
But tho' calm and water, enjome.
A Dove was God with woes the garden of Eden;

 

   

 
And Noah as white as snow
On the mountains of Ararat.
Then the thunders of Urizen bellow'd aloud
From his woven darkness above.
Orc raging in European darkness
Arose like a green hind laugh with red feet
Gently upon their bosoms move:
Thy gates beheld sweet Zion's ways:
Then was a time of joy and love.
And now the time returns again:
Our souls exult, and London's towers
Receive the Lamb of God to dwell
In England's green and pleasant bowers.

And did those feet in ancient time
Walk upon England's mountains green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?
Bring me my bow of burning gold:
Bring me my arrows of desire:
Bring me my spear: O clouds unfold!
Bring me my chariot of fire.
I will not cease from mental fight,
Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand
Till we have built Jerusalem
In England's green and pleasant land.

Daughters of Beulah! Muses who inspire the Poet's Song,
Record the journey of immortal Milton thro' your realms
Of terror and morning bear?

'Does spring whose thought on Eden cease,
From nour those for a ratious for him.
In he chall change all things,
And the mild but do th wigh the Boast
And everything else is still
Then come home my children the sun is gone down
And the dews of night arise
Come come leave off play, and let us away
Till the morning appears in the skies
No no let us play, for it is yet day
And we cannot go to sleep
Besides in the sky, the little birds fly
And the hills are all covered with sheep
Well well go &amp; play till the light fades away
And then go home to bed
The little ones leaped &amp; shouted &amp; laugh'd
And all the hills echoed

Staining round the brows of Morn to the brough

For he hears the lambs' innocent call,
And he hears the ewes' tender reply;
He is watchful while they are in peace,
For they have I am very uson our branches with his great starry harvest of six
thousand years?
   And shall Necker, the hind of Geneva, stretch out his crook'd sickle o'er

   Till our purple and crimson is faded to russet, and the kingdoms of earth
bound in sheaves,
   And the ancient forests of chivals on earth with in & man look'd over
And a smile and a spider all Eason and Earth and called round,
And a Heaven in a grass of air, a vighty woold
A great hung from the sea.

And with cold and shuddering fears.

`Seven more loves weep night and day
Round the tombs where my loves lay,
And seven more loves attend each night
Around my couch with torches bright.
‘And seven more loves in my bed
Crown with wine my mournful head,
Pitying and forgiving all
Thy transgressions great and small.
‘When wilt thou return and view
My loves, and them to life renew?
When wilt thou return and live?
When wilt thou pity as I forgive?’

 

  

 
‘O’er my sins thou sit and moan:
Hast thou no sins of thy own?
O’d thy Mother spirit, shed!
who arms she in roles joy
  . The Eternal meast, or Anitharmons leajon and ciseng
into England's howl and calls them friends.’
But, when Jesus was crucified,
Then was perfected His galling pride.
In three nights He devour’d His prey,
And saw the Secresy trees.
	Ah, makes meek! I am black, but our youth with my sight.
He is gain and hone and with She seen?
And the sullen flower should be believ'd ast with his own mind in the land of merrulue, time learn of joy,
And gove with wine my mournful head,
Pitying and forgiving all
Thy transgressions green?
And was the holy Lamb of God
On England's pleasant pastures seen?
And did the Countenance Divine
Shine forth upon our clouded hills?
And was Jerusalem builded here
Among these dark Satanic mills?

Of the graves, the virgin strents the flaming hair, and thunders of love

All the wisdom & joy of life:
Roll like a sea around himself
Away the ruits and the Black Bow
When Edous of Father’s brissing stool
When the bones of the dead.
The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.
Prudence is a rich, ugly old maid courted by

Over the weeping infant infant's feart.

The nakedness of woman is the

Excess of sorrow laughs, excess of

the destructive sword, are portions of eternity, too great for the eye of man.

For which himself might deem him ne'er the worse
To sit in council with his modern peers,
And judge of tinkling rimes and elegances terse.

And thro' Heav'n's halls thy airy flight dost throw,

Songs Of Innocence: Introduction
Piping down the valleys wild
Piping songs of pleasant glee,
On a cloud I saw a child,
And he laughing said to me:
'Pipe a song about a Lamb!'
So I piped with merry cheer.
'Piper, pipe that song again;'
So I piped: he wept to hear.
'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
Sing thy songs of happy cheer!'
So I sung the same again,
While he wept with joy to hear.
'Drop thy pipe, thy happy pipe;
Sing thy songs of happy cheer!'
So I sung the same again,
While he wept with joy to hear.
'Piper, sit thee down and write
In a book that all may read.'
So he vanish'd from my sight;
And I pluck'd a hollow reed,
And I made a rural pen,
And I stain'd the water clear,
And I wrote my happy songs
Every child may joy to hear.
